Data

The data directory contains the historical stock market data used for training and testing the machine learning models. Ensure that your data is in the required format before running the project.

Models

This project includes various machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forest, and LSTM neural networks. You can find these models in the models directory. Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to achieve the best results for your specific use case.

Evaluation

We evaluate the models based on standard metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). You can find the evaluation results in the project's output.
